## Frequently Asked Questions (also known as questions no one asked)

### Why STH?

First of all, STH is not used as an abbreviation of 'something'. I love giving my projects random names related to things happening at that moment. In this case, STH stands for Stairway to Heaven, the beautiful song that was playing at the exact moment I ran the create-next-app prompt. 

### What technologies are being used on this project?

As I already mention before, this project was created using Next.js. Moreover, Firebase Realtime Database, Sass and Vercel are being used. But undoubtedly, the most awesome tool is the OpenAI API, which is used to randomly generate the daily games using its artificial intelligence model.

### Were these questions written by ChatGPT? 

No, they were not. At least not all of them...
